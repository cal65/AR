Der Zusatzvertrag und die daraus resultierende Preisgleitung wurde von  unserer Seite ordnungsgemäß durchgeführt, da im Zusatzvertrag keine neuen Preisindexe( Lohn- und Material) vereinbart wurden, müssen zwingend die Werte aus dem Reservierungsvertrag genommen werden, dadurch ergibt sich dieser Preisanstieg.  -Lösungsvorschlag-Die hier aufgeführte Preissteigerung von 16,687%(4.500,00 Euro,netto)  sollte bei ca.4-4,5 %(ca.1000-1.100Euro,netto) liegen, =-3.400,00 Euro netto( Gutschrift)  2.       SSV von 949,00 Euro netto  -Lösungsvorschlag 550,00 Euro=- 400,00 Euro netto( Gutschrift)  3.       2-2,5 Tage Ausfallzeit x1.500,00 Euro netto= 3.750,00 Euro netto    In der Summe kommen wir auf 7.550,00 Euro,     Ich kann Ihnen hier eine Kulanz-Gutschrift in Höhe von 7.500,00 Euro netto, anbieten.

The Commanding Officer (Lt. Sims) has taken this issue to Navy legal. I have been advised that it will most likely get paid but it will take a lot of time as it is a government bureaucracy. It is working its way through the chain of command. I do not know when we will see payment.  As for 97583689, Sue has been working with Sharron Tapler and Valerie Moore to get this item paid. It is stuck in the WAWF system on some technicalities. We are working with them to try and resolve. 06-Aug-2015 02:32:38 PM PEROCIER, JONATHEN  Collector Comment: Good Afternoon - Please provide an update to this dispute workflow.

This means that we are responsible for the product to be on spec up on arrival to a discharge port with not stops in between. BOL are typically (cargo discharge ports) for BOPEC in Bonaire of for Bahamas Free port BORCO terminal. Our contract does not mention any hop guaranty to secondary or any other terminal in the region. Unless the two above mentioned ones. Nether it is mentioned that we are giving guaranty to any terminal after discharging the product to the BOL destination. Seems that these cargoes have been discharged at BOPEC, reloaded and PDVSA wants us to cover the treatments costs under a different BOL which is in conflict with the ISLA contract.

This means that we are responsible for the product to be on spec up on arrival to a discharge port with not stops in between. BOL are typically (cargo discharge ports) for BOPEC in Bonaire of for Bahamas Free port BORCO terminal. Our contract does not mention any hop guaranty to secondary or any other terminal in the region. Unless the two above mentioned ones. Nether it is mentioned that we are giving guaranty to any terminal after discharging the product to the BOL destination. Seems that these cargoes have been discharged at BOPEC, reloaded and PDVSA wants us to cover the treatments costs under a different BOL which is in conflict with the ISLA contract.
